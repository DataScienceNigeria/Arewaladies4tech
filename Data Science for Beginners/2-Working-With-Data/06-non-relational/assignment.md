# Soda Profits

## Instructions

The [Coca Cola Co spreadsheet](CocaColaCo.xlsx) is missing some calculations. Your task is to: 

1. Calculate the Gross profits of FY '15, '16, '17, and '18
    - Gross Profit = Net Operating revenues - Cost of goods sold
1. Calculate the average of all the gross profits. Try to do this with a function.
    - Average = Sum of gross profits divided by the number of fiscal years (10)
    - Documentation on the [AVERAGE function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/average-function-047bac88-d466-426c-a32b-8f33eb960cf6)
1. This is an Excel file, but it should be editable in any spreadsheet platform
