# Low code/No code Data Science project on Azure ML

## Instructions

We saw how to use the Azure ML platform to train, deploy and consume a model in a Low code/No code fashion. Now look around for some data that you could use to train an other model, deploy it and consume it. You can look for datasets on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) and [Azure Open Datasets](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/open-datasets/catalog?WT.mc_id=academic-77958-bethanycheum&ocid=AID3041109).

## Rubric

| Exemplary | Adequate | Needs Improvement |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
|When uploading the data you took care of changing the feature's type if necessary. You also cleaned the data if needed. You ran a training on a dataset through AutoML, and you checked the model explanations. You deployed the best model and you were able to consume it. | When uploading the data you took care of changing the feature's type if necessary. You ran a training on a dataset through AutoML, you deployed the best model and you were able to consume it. | You have deployed the best model trained by AutoML and you were able to consume it. |
