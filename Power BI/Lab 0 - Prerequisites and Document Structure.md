## Document Structure
This document and the documents that follow have two main sections:

**Power BI Desktop**: This section highlights the features available in Power BI Desktop and
walks the user through the process of bringing in data from data sources, organizing data in
a model and creating visualizations.

**Power BI Service**: This section highlights the features available in Power BI Service including
the ability to publish the Power BI Desktop model to the web, creating and sharing a
dashboard, and Q&A.

The lab includes steps for the user to follow along together with associated screenshots that provide
a visual aid. In the screenshots, sections are highlighted with red or orange boxes to indicate the
area the user needs to focus on.
Users should use their own files from Lab 1 through Lab 5. The solutions provided for each lab are
a final product to reference. The solutions are not meant to be the starting point for each lab.

**NOTE**: This lab uses real, anonymized data provided by ObviEnce, LLC. Visit their
site to learn about their services: www.obvience.com. This data is property of
ObviEnce, LLC and has been shared for the purpose of demonstrating Power BI
functionality with industry sample data. Any use of this data must include this
attribution to ObviEnce, LLC.

## Dataset
The dataset you will you use for this program is a sales and market share analysis. This
type of analysis is very common for a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). Unlike the Chief Financial
Officer (CFO), a CMO is focused not only on the company’s performance internally (how well do our
products sell) but also externally (how well do we do against competing products).
The company, VanArsdel, manufactures expensive retail products that can be used for fun as well as
work. This company sells their products directly to consumers nationwide as well as in several other
countries.

**Please note**: There is a problem with the Nigeria International Sales data; this is
by design so that users can learn how to shape data.

By the end of the class, you will build a report which will look like the screenshot below. The CMO
can use this report to analyze VanArsdel’s performance.
