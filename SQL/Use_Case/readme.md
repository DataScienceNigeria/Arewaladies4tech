## Getting Started

To run these SQL scripts, you'll need access to a SQL database and a SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.). Here are the steps to get started:

1. **Install a SQL Database**: If you don't have a SQL database installed, you can choose one depending on your preference and operating system. Some popular options include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

2. **Create a Database**: You can either create a new database or use an existing one, depending on your needs. You may need to configure database connection settings in the scripts if necessary.

3. **Run the Scripts**: Open your SQL client and connect to the database you created. Then, open the SQL script you want to run and execute it. Each script may include comments explaining its purpose and usage.
