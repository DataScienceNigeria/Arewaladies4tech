    "We have introduced one more parameter called **temperature**, which is used to indicate how hard we should stick to the highest probability. If temperature is 1.0, we do fair multinomial sampling, and when temperature goes to infinity - all probabilities become equal, and we randomly select next character. In the example below we can observe that the text becomes meaningless when we increase the temperature too much, and it resembles \"cycled\" hard-generated text when it becomes closer to 0. "
